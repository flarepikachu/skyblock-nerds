Here you\u0026rsquo;ll find a bunch of guides that will hopefully improve your writing significantly.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"About Us"},{"content":"This is a guide regarding how to write suggestions for SkyBlock Nerds. The goal of this guide is so that community members can create good and complete suggestions that can move down the greenlit pipeline faster.\nWhile this guide is intended for members of SkyBlock Nerds, this guide is totally applicable towards writing suggestions on the Hypixel Forums and giving ideas and feedback for other projects.\nWhat makes a good suggestion? A good suggestion will meet the following parameters:\nThe suggestion is clearly written. The design of the suggestion is fully complete. The suggestion solves a significant issue in Hypixel SkyBlock. The suggestion design is considerate of it\u0026rsquo;s potential issues and limitations and attempts to solve them. Suggestion Clarity There are times where submitted suggestions in SkyBlock Nerds are hard to read, if not outright unreadable. The following things should be easily inferred when reading a suggestion:\nWhat the suggestion is about. What the suggestion is looking to change. What are the details of the suggestion. Why are the suggested changes the best way to tackle that issue. Item tooltips generated with the /gen bot command are appreciated, but I\u0026rsquo;d much rather have a mockup of the item tooltip written in text form. This is because designers will often make minor changes to items, resulting in the tooltip being outdated. Item tooltip information written in text form is much appreciated as it will allow designers to easily edit the tooltip information and create an updated version of the item.\nWhile designers are familiar with Hypixel SkyBlock, developers may not be familiar with parts of content in the game. Features mentioned in a suggestion should be very clearly defined for developer viewing. If the suggestion is a feature modification, make sure all the required information about the feature is given to make the review and development processes easier.\nRework the Salvage Menu to incorporate Mass Salvage\nThe salvage function allows players to turn their items into essence of various types. This function can be accessed at Malik in the Dungeon Hub and at Alwin and Igor in the Crimson Isle.\nThe current menu only allows players to salvage items one at a time. With players getting dozens of items per Dungeon run, it is hugely inconvenient to have to individually salvage these items.\nA clear suggestion does not necessarily have to be lengthy. The following is a perfectly fine suggestion:\nAdd Refined Mineral to Mining Sack\nFor the above suggestion, the issue is easily inferrable as Refined Mineral being missing from the Mining Sack. Even so, it can benefit from slightly more explanation as follows:\nRefined Mineral should be added to the Mining Sack as it\u0026rsquo;s an item that often clogs the player\u0026rsquo;s inventory during Mining Fiestas.\nComplete Suggestion Design There are plenty of good suggestion submissions that are hindered by incomplete design, mostly occuring with new item submissions. When submitting a new item suggestion, make sure all of the following information is given:\nStats, Abilities and Effects Stats and Abilities of your suggested item are hard to miss (unless it\u0026rsquo;s a forums suggestion, in that case anything is possible!!). Make sure the stats, abilities and effects of your suggested item/feature are clearly defined. Obtainment Method Items need a method of obtainment and features need a point of access. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to come up with good feature suggestions but forget to add where that feature can be accessed. Required Assets (Item Textures) Skull items like accessories and equipment need textures. You can try your hand at creating your own skin textures, or write down design concepts for the texture of your new item so that our artist can make it. Significance of Suggestion From now on, features and feature changes will only be approved if the suggested change solves a significant issue in the game. There\u0026rsquo;s likely plenty of minor changes we can make to GUIs and random pieces of content, but it\u0026rsquo;s honestly a waste of time for me to finalize and approve insignificant changes to some GUI. If a change has very little significance to the game, don\u0026rsquo;t suggest them.\nItem suggestions will only be approved if they slot in perfectly with existing content, if the design is fully complete, and if the item has a good purpose in the game.\nMetaphysical Serum\nThe Metaphysical Serum is a consumable that permanently reduces the length of the chain required to get Superpairs clicks, i.e. if you required a chain of 12 to get 3 clicks, you would need 11 after drinking the serum. 3 serums can be drank by a player, reducing the chains required for 3 clicks from 12 and 9, to 9 and 6 respectively.\nThis would make doing experiments less boring and a lot faster, which would encourage more people to do them (and consequently, put more t6 and t7 enchantments in the market).\nSuggestion Written by ChocolateTimbits\nImpact and Feasibility Assessment ","date":"2023-12-25","id":3,"permalink":"/docs/writing/writing-suggestions/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is a guide regarding how to write suggestions for SkyBlock Nerds.
